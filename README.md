# odin-recipes
This is my first project in TOP. I have made a recipe webpage where I'll be demonstrating the fundamentals of HTML & CSS and uploading it to my GitHub repository. 
The basics I have conducted were the following:
Building a webpage by creating a html file, a list of recipes, linking them to relative links, and the basics of Git such as adding commit messages and pushing it to my GitHub repository. Throughout this recipe project, I have incorporated some basics of CSS elements to style and add design to my webpage.
